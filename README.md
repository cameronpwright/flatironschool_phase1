## Background

Flatiron Partners is an investment firm that sources opportunities in struggling businesses and uses a data-driven approach to turn things around. After a portfolio review, the Flatiron team decided they were lacking
exposure to the transportation industry and began looking for attractive opportunities.

Aviasurance is an aviation insurance firm that has struggled in recent years due to poor risk management. Its legacy operations lack rigorous data sourcing and analysis. Flatiron wants to 
completely revamp how Aviasurance sources and uses data in its pricing and its policywriting functions in order to minimize potential payouts.

Given that aviation insurance is a new business line for Flatiron, the first step is to look at the trends in aviation incidents over the past few decades and issue some high-level recommendations based on that data.

## Limitations
The dataset which is being used does not paint a comprehensive portrait of the aviation industry landscape. This dataset doesn't contain information on <i>all</i> flights that took place during the time period, and 
as such, is not able to make claims about relative frequency of aviation incidents over the time period. I adopted the approach of finding a way to make comparative claims <i>within</i> the dataset by focusing on
the relative severity of incidents using mortality rate as the comparison metric.

## Recommendations

After analyzing the Aviation incidents dataset, I have issued three recommendations for Flatiron Partners while revamping Aviasurance:
<ul>
  <li>Charge higher rates for dual-engine aircraft</li>
  <li>Charge higher rates for aircraft makes with higher mortality rates (e.g., Beech and Mooney)</li>
  <li>Require policyholders to have comprehensive safety policies for flight operations that take place near the ground (e.g., approach, taxi)</li>
</ul>

## Next Steps

To further develop these recommendations and to ensure a successful turnaround of Aviasurance, Flatiron Partners should pair the incident data with comprehensive data about all flights in the same timespan and geography.
Once these recommendations are implemented, they should be tracked and the data reviewed on a periodic basis to measure success.
